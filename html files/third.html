    <h1>How to Answer “Tell Me About Yourself” in an Interview?</h1>
    <p>“Hi, My name is Anurag Sharma. ​I’ve recently done my Bachelors in Technology with Computer Science stream from XYZ University with 9 CGPA. Also, I did my 12th & 10th from CBSE Board in the year 2016 and 2014 respectively. Though I am currently staying in Delhi – I was born and brought up in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, and did my schooling from there itself. Considering my family background details – we’re 4 members in the family. Apart from my parents, I have a sibling – an elder brother.</p>

<p>As you’d have known – I am here for the role of ABC. Coming to my skills I know *mention all those skills that you possess and are relevant to the job role that you’re applying for*. I had 2 internships as well in this particular domain where along with core technical things I also learned organizational ethics and discipline. Moreover, I also did 2 successful individual projects *on the particular technology* in my college tenure. *You can also opt to brief the project & internship details here*</p>

<p>To be honest, my short-term goal is to get a job in a reputed company like *the company name for which you’re applying* where I can use my skills and knowledge to deliver value-added result and in long term, the goal would be to achieve a good position in the particular company to scale up organization’s production & growth rate and at the same time for the betterment of my personal career growth as well. Other than that, if I talk about my strengths – I can say that I’m a quick learner, team player, adaptable and creative person – and I do guess that these strengths of mine are perfectly suitable for this job role.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, playing outdoor sports, and sometimes cooking.</p>

<p>That’s all about me. And yes, thanks for the opportunity given to introduce myself!”</p>
