    <h1>How to Answer “Why Should We Hire You” in an Interview?</h1>
    <p>
        Sir/mam, as you would’ve already seen in my resume that my degree program, major and minor there, my technical skill set, college projects, and previous 2 internships all coincide with this particular job role. And I’m a bit confident that all that I’ve done in my past will translate well into this job position.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it’s not just my educational background or past internships & projects that make me a good fit for this job role – but, as I read the job description before applying, it made me understand that this job role primarily requires an individual who can build logic and solve problems efficiently and optimally. *you can find out what the companies require from the individuals for the particular job roles by reading out their job description and prepare the answer accordingly* And this is an area I’m very good at. Just for an example, *tell any past incident where you justified your these skills or abilities in real-life, and it should sound genuine*.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, let me tell you sir that I may not be someone extraordinary or very special and there may be other candidates who’re possessing a similar skillset or educational background like me but some of my strengths like – I am a coachable person, my willingness to learn, my passion towards my work, team-oriented personality, delivering results on time, and a few others fit perfectly for this particular job role. *you can also opt to mention some of your accomplishments, recognitions, etc. here, relevant to the job profile, that can give you an edge over other candidates*”
